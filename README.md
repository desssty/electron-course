# Electron Course

**Electron Course** is a learning project demonstrating how to build a desktop application using **Electron**, **React**, and **TypeScript**.  
It showcases a modular approach to structuring both the Electron main process and the React renderer process, as well as implementing advanced desktop-specific features such as a custom window frame, system tray integration, and fully type-safe IPC communication.

## üöÄ Technologies

- [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) ‚Äì cross-platform desktop development
- [React 19](https://react.dev/) ‚Äì building the user interface
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) ‚Äì static type checking
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) ‚Äì fast build and development server
- [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) ‚Äì end-to-end testing
- [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) ‚Äì unit testing

## üì¶ Project Structure

- `src/electron/` ‚Äì Main process logic (application lifecycle, tray, menu, system resource management, IPC)
- `src/ui/` ‚Äì Renderer process (React-based user interface)
- `e2e/` ‚Äì End-to-end tests using Playwright
